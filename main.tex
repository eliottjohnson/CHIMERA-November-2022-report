\section{Introduction} %all
\input{sections/Introduction.tex}

\section{Beam properties - PS configuration and T8 beam instruments}
% as set in the PS and measured by the beam instruments

\subsection{Proton Synchrotron beam energy} % Eliott
% Some intro about how it is defined, including the lookup tables
% The nice colour showing which energy was used during each moment of the test
\input{sections/PS_beam_energy.tex}

\subsection{Beam intensity} % Eliott, Kacper
% RFKO and gain settings throughout the test
% Intensity measurements on SEC and XION, including intensity vs. gain
\input{sections/Beam_intensity.tex}


\subsection{Spill time profile} % Eliott
% Gas scintillator, SEC, XION, etc.
% Diode SMU measurements could be included here, even if introduced later
\input{sections/Spill_time_profile.tex}

\subsection{Beam spatial profile} %Eliott, Kacper
% MWPC, Independence of beam profile with beam intensity, impact of energy on the beam shape, “explanation” of the dips (i.e. comparison with and without Montract), etc.
\input{sections/Beam_spatial_profile.tex}

\section{Beam properties - solid state detector in DUT position}
% as measured by the silicon diode

\subsection{Setup} % Natalia
% Montrac, cabling, x-y table, degraders/collimators, etc.
\input{sections/Setup.tex}

\subsection{Diode as a flux monitor} % Kacper
% Including notably the correlation with SEC and XION
\input{sections/Diode_as_flux_monitor.tex}

\subsection{Energy deposition distributions} % Andreas, Natalia
% « Primary » energies, including mysterious energy changes
% Comparison with GSI, which we can consider as calibration/reference
% Impact of degraders
% Impact of collimation
\input{sections/Energy_deposition_distributions.tex}

\section{Other measurements}
\subsection{SRAM memories} % Andrea
% SEU counts versus beam intensity
% (note: for actual SEU cross section value/fluence measurements, we would need to accurately know the beam LET, which will in turn likely need to at least partially rely on a combination of simulations and diode measurements. But, we can try to, in first instance, focus on the diode measurements – also because these mysterious energy changes cannot be accounted for in FLUKA, unless understood)

\subsection{Scintillator} % Andreas
\input{sections/Scintillator.tex}
